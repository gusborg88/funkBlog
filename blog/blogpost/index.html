    <p>HELLO EVERYONE READING THIS!!!</p>
<p>This is the first OFFICIAL blog post! If you are reading this the day it is published... it means you are a maniac and probably stalk me!</p>
<p>This is a bit of a post to look back at, and I suppose to document the process of even MAKING this damn blog!

<p>ANYWAYS, we want to make lil bloggy stuff, twitter is annoying and i think we like to keep to ourselves a lot of the time. 
We don't like comments so don't expect some mf forum or someshit around here. </p>
<p>This is also a general revamp of the funkin website, since we are trying to be more legit and real and PRESENTABLE!!!</p>
<p>Lil tech details... this blog is made with ZOLA STATIC SITE GENERATOR!!!</p>
<p>I have been trying to chip away on this blog every day for at least 20mins-1hr, and it has been fun lil side adventure heheh.</p>
<p>captains log donezo</p>
