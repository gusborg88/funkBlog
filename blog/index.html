            <section class="center"><p>right now these are manually created by me...but eventually... they will be automated too hahahah!!!</p>
<p>I gotta fix somethin up with github actions and payments, we have a crazy automated system with FNF, but since it's on a private branch, we only have a certain amount of MINUTES we can use! I need to write something like a discord bot that can run 24/7 and/or doesn't USE the as much Github minutes... in the FNF repo, there's definitely room for improvement in terms of like... MINUTE optimization... lol</p>
<p>anyways this week was a bit of a slow week with the BLOG DEVELOPMENTS. It's mostly me, ninjamuffin!! writing blogs this week! I'll try to give people some insight on some things we been cookin up</p>

            <section class="center"><p>** written by PrincessMtH**
a BPM is how many beats there are per minute.</p>
<p>sounds straightforward, but, what is a &quot;beat&quot;? well in my lil DAW there's 4 beats per bar, so it's just a 4th of a bar, clearly. but not all music is written like that. sometimes there's 3 beats per bar... we call that 3/4. so the 3 in that means how many beats there are, and the 4 means... what does the 4 mean...? something to do with steps, surely?</p>

            <section class="center"><p>HELLO EVERYONE READING THIS!!!</p>
<p>This is the first OFFICIAL blog post! If you are reading this the day it is published... it means you are a maniac and probably stalk me!</p>
<p>This is a bit of a post to look back at, and I suppose to document the process of even MAKING this damn blog!
Moreso for the people in the future looking back a billion blogposts and reading this, and see where this blog started!
(or digging through my github to see an abandoned project, doh!)</p>
